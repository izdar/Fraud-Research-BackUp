Sharing is caring .Dear friend ,ARE YOU SAVED ? IF YOU DIED TONIGHT WILL YOU GO TO HEAVEN OR HELL?\nThe Bible says: God is holy and heaven is holy which means perfect. God can never let anybody or anything imperfect or sinful enter heaven.\nHave you ever lied once? Stolen once? Hated once? The answer is yes .This makes you a liar, a thief and a murderer according to God. So if you were to die this night you will go to hell because you have sinned and the punishment of sin is death.\n    The excellent news is that GOD wants you in heaven with Him. But as a just GOD, He has to punish your sins. He has provided a way to save you .There is someone perfect who was willing to take your punishment, mine and the one of the whole world.\n John 3:16 says: \u201cFor God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.\u201d\nSo Christ died on the cross for our sins.\n         \n                        WHAT CAN YOU DO TO BE SAVED?\n1- Admit you are a sinner.\n                                    2-Be willing to turn from your sins and turn to God (repent).\n                                    3-Believe that Jesus died for you, was buried and rose from the dead. Romans 10:9 say: \u201cthat if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.\u201d\n                                    4-Now through prayer, invite Jesus into your life to become your personal savior.\n                                     5- Pray this prayer of salvation :( Say it aloud)\nDear God, I come to you in the name of Jesus. I admit I am a sinner. I thank you that you loved me so much to send Your Son to die in my place. I believe in my heart that Jesus Christ died on the cross and shed His blood for my sins, was buried and rose again the thirth day.\nI am willing to turn from my sins .I ask you to forgive me Father.\nI now invite you Lord Jesus, to come into my heart and life as my personal Lord and Savior. Amen.\nNOW YOU ARE SAVED OR BORN AGAIN WHAT DO YOU DO AFTER?                   \n1-Read your Bible everyday to get to know Christ better.\n2-Talk to God in prayer everyday.\n3-Be baptized, worship, fellowship and serve with other Christians in a good bibelbelieving church.\n4-Tell others about Jesus.\nNB: Congratulations .You have just made the most important decision of your life by accepting Jesus.\n\n\n TO START TO LEARN ABOUT GOD :www.EnseigneMoi.com\n-www.cfaith  .com                    \n                                                                      -Watch Ron Wyatt Amazing Discoveries Full on youtube.", "The only YouTuber who doesn\u2019t have a ten minute long intro", "You're so pretty", "Pls subt\u00edtulos en espa\u00f1oool", "you look soooo nicf .........................     suparp", "cute\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d", "\ud83d\ude1b\ud83d\ude1b", "\ud83d\ude1b\ud83d\ude1b", "Beautiful", "Enjoyed the video will try concealer before adding the rest of the colors.

You spend a lot of time writing great content, visitors are coming but the payment is very low. Traditional contextual advertising, such as Google Adsense, don\u2019t work so great on websites with many pages and articles, because visitors are paying more attention to the text and they completely ignore the ads. More, the average pay per click from Google Adsense and other display advertising networks are in decline lately.\n\nAre you tired of writing articles every day and to only get a $100 check at the end of the month ? Then you have to take a second writing job so you can keep up with expenses, and to finally struggle with your blog and to stop your chance to live your dream ? Most people fail on blogging because it is not bringing up enough money. Successful bloggers are getting most of their income by promoting affiliate products. However, this is not easy because you have to post and maintain all your affiliate links. What if you had to insert affiliate links in 500 posts, or 1000? That will take an enormous amount of time. What if one of the products you placed links for changed affiliate network and you have to change all the links ? Dealing with affiliate links on a high content blog may take all your free time so you are going nowhere.\n\nWp Auto Affiliate Links will save you hundreds of hours of work by automatically adding affiliate links into your content. Links from Amazon, Clickbank, Ebay, Shareasale, Commission Junction, Envato, Walmart or Bestbuy can be automatically displayed trough your content. Here is an example of how the plugin transform a normal article into a money making vehicle:\nTop bloggers are using affiliate marketing instead of contextual advertising so they can earn 6 figures. Lately, most webmasters are experiencing low earnings at Adsense, topping few dollars for every 1000 visitors. On the other hand, if you promote affiliate products, the average commission you get is between 10$ and 50$. From every 1000 visitors to your website you will generate at least 1 sale. You can generate more if you have affiliate links in every post or page.\n\nBenefits of using Wp Auto Affiliate Links PRO features\n\nEarn more money from affiliate marketing\nSave time adding and managing affiliate links\nFocus more on your content and website\nGet rid of annoying ads and low payouts\nImprove your web business", "https://www.000webhost.com/1055626.html\nWe offer completely ad-free cPanel web hosting.

You were only interrupted if the mechanic was literally game-changing, and the thing I thought was really neat was that more information was optional for a small fee of in-game gold to learn some neat tips and tricks, so in a sense the game rewards you for trying out new things with the major mechanics and exploring on your own at your own pace.

Do a little bit of research on who owns the rights to the information which is stored through Google Docs on Google sites. Google says it does . My foot and Google can go jump. So if you have returned your magnum opus and strode it through Google docs online Google says that your work belongs to it and it can be edited and used by Google and you have no right to say anything otherwise.

Most people who weight train, myself included before I learned better, impinge their shoulder mobility by not stretching and taking care of their shoulder health enough. When it comes to handstands, you need to be able to stand normally (with your back straight, or flush against a wall) and lift your shoulders directly above your head. You will often find most people who have weight trained can't do it without arching their back. That means in the handstand you aren't in an efficient line for the weight to press through your body like a standing rod, there is pressure on the shoulders, which is corrected by an arched back. That was one of the main problems I was having until I researched into it. After working on shoulder mobility for several weeks and months, and really pushing through the shoulders to get them in a straight line with my body when wall standing, holding the freestanding handstand became so much easier.", "I can get into a wall stand or a wobbly hand stand but through one leg kick - is it necessary to do it both legs together?", "Hey Ryan and gang, I have a question: I see you doing more of a press to handstand when you progress to the freestanding HS.

I would just add a word about the design of a handstand training program. \n\nIn my experience, it is something often not very clear to the ones who approach a skill-based training program for the first time, so I think it deserves a further note.\n\nIn the handstand practice, it is useful to distinguish two aspects which require a different training strategy to be developed: a merely \"physical\" aspect and a strictly \"skill\" aspect.\n\n(1) the \"physical\" aspect is about to be comfortable in an inverted position. \nI want my wirst to be ready to support my bodyweight while in full extension, I want my shoulders to be strong enough in a fully flexed position, I want my core to be solid so it can stabilize the spine and the pelvis. A program structured in sets and reps works well to develop these qualities, and the sets and reps scheme proposed in the video is very valid.\n\n(2) the \"skill\" aspect is about how to BALANCE in an inverted position.\nOnce I can hold a beautifully alined wall handstand, sets and reps are no more useful. To develop this attribute, it is way better to set a clock on a convenient amount of time, and just play with the movement, only aiming for QUALITY movement. The goal is to feel a good balance even just for one second. No muscle soreness required, no struggles. I want my body to \"remember\" only quality balance.\n\nMoreover, this concept can be easily translated in GMB words: \n - STRENGTH & FLEXIBILITY programming -> Use sets and reps  \n - MOTOR CONTROL programming -> Use time based sessions. \n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts.", "I've had weak wrists for a loooong time since working a desk job. Putting any weight on the back of my hands while doing the warmup was pretty much impossible. All it took was a week of consistent practice when I started Elements and I had so much more strength and range of motion for that specific stretch.

My workout lifestyle had always been: do some pushups or abs for a week, then do nothing for 4 months. I saw this and liked the concept of training consistently and patiently for a skill. I started training my wrists and handstand. Besides having much stronger wrists and shoulders now, I have also developed a real habit of good exercise for the first time ever, and it doesn't bore me like it used to. In this past year, I've been able to play around with handstands, I got the rings muscle up, then finally bought and finished Rings 1.

I've studied Pilates and one of the main principles is to engage and strengthen the transverus abdominus (TVA) to stabilize the pelvis and lower spine. I've always had difficulty with how I've seen coaches teach the hollow body hold without addressing this issue.  We practice hollow body holds at the crossfit style gym that I go to and I continually see people using a lot of rectus abdominus to assist in this movement, I know that because I see the abs \"pop up\" as they contract and that's something that I've been trained to see as not very effective at actually improving core stability.  The cues we would use in pilates are to \"imprint\" the spine which means to engage the obliques to pull the rib cage and hip closer together, which effectively pulls out the lumbar curve, and then stabilize by pulling the transversus abdominus up and in towards the spine, which, if done correctly and if there's enough strength in the muscle, keeps the abs flat and prevents the rectus abdominus from trying to take over in the movement.  I especially see the rectus abdominus taking over as people try to extend and lower the legs when the TVA isn't strong enough to hold the pelvis in the imprinted position against the weight of the legs.  In the video above, I don't see Ryan's rectus popping up and taking over the movement, which to me would mean that he's developed the strength in his transversus to stabilize his pelvis against the weight of his legs..and obviously that would be true in his case given how strong he is...but for most people just learning the hollow body hold do you find there is an issue with  the rectus abdominus \"popping up\" and taking over at the expense of building a stronger TVA?  How do you address it or does it even need to be addressed?"], ["Derek very good tutorial , helped me lot.
